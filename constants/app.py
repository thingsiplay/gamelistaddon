""" Provides basic meta information about the main program.

    What this class does is basically saving constants about the main
    program.  The main benefit realizing this as a class is to be able
    to easily import and read by other tools, in example to read the
    current version number.

    Usage:
        APP = app.App(__file__)
        print(APP.VERSION)

    Attributes
    ----------
    NAME : str
        Name of the app or project.
    SOURCE : str
        The sourece string which is added when the main app adds a
        source attribute to the game-elements in the XML files.  It
        serves as an id.
    VERSION : str
        Current version of the project.
    CREATOR : str
        Developer and creator of the project.
    DESC : str
        Short description of the project.
    LICENSE : str
        License text of the project.
    EXEPATH : str
        Full path of the current executed application.  This solves
        links too, so the attribute will point to the final Python
