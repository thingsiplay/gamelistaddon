<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/EmulationStation/#gamelistxml-edits">gamelist.xml</a> files are databases for the use in <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/EmulationStation/">EmulationStation</a>, in example in RetroPie. They contain all paths and meta information for each system. Usually those files are created by some sort of <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Scraper/">scraper tools</a> and do not require any manual editing. However sometimes there are cases when manually editing is required. Editing such files in a text editor has some traps and is just a pain.</p>
<p>This app will check for existing entries to and make sure the file is written in correct format. I started this project because there was no application on Linux that fulfill my needs. Also this is a good exercise to me learning more about programming.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Once unpacked and the requirements are met, it is easy as running <strong>GamelistAddon.py</strong> or the run script. The app provides two main functionality modes: <em>Add Game</em> and <em>Merge Gamelists</em>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Add Game</strong>-mode only the fields with content will be written to the file, but <em>path</em> is required. The game entry can be added to an existing gamelist.xml or saved as a new file created from scratch. When overwriting to an existing file, a check if the game is already existing will be made. The comparison is done at basename level of the path field, ignoring the directory portion. This allows for detecting any game, regardless of how the path is noted (in example relative notion). In example:</p>
<pre><code>./game.gb
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/gb/game.gb</code></pre>
<p>is treated as identical game. Currently if a dublication is detected, the user action is limited to ignoring or replacing the whole game entry. The <em>import</em> button will load up the first found entry from a selected gamelist.xml file. Any of the edit fields in the GUI act as af filter for searching. Only one of the active filters need to match, in order to read the entire game entry.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Merge Gamelists</strong>-mode two XML files must be selected. The first one act as base content to compare against and second file should have new content to add. The order is important. When saving a new output XML file, both input files game entries are compared at basename level (described above). The selected output file will be created from scratch with the content of the input files. The update log view will be populated with all newly added game entries only.</p>
<p>As a little bonus, in the app folder is a separate commandline tool <strong>merge.py</strong> with merge functionality from the main app. It does not require PyQt5 and could be used for automation or testing. Currently if there is any error, then the program will stop and output <em>ERROR</em> on screen. On success the paths of each newly added game entries are output. Important: On default no files are saved and the original XML files are untouched. Check the options and how to specify an output file with</p>
<pre><code>./merge.py -h.</code></pre>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>When running Python version directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python: 3.6.9</li>
<li>PyQt5: 5.15.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional requirements when building standalone distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuitka: 0.6.8.4</li>
<li>Qt Designer: 5.9.5</li>
<li>Pandoc: 1.19.2.4</li>
<li>Linux compatible operating system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gnu-linux">GNU / Linux</h3>
<p>Download the Python release build. You need Python 3 and PyQt 5 installed on your system to run the application. Source code is saved on Github and contains additional files and building scripts. The standalone release build is a compiled executable binary for Linux. It eliminates the need for any of the requirements listed above, besides the operating system.</p>
<h3 id="windows-and-macos">Windows and MacOS</h3>
<p>Currently only Linux is tested and supported. There are no standalone builds for Windows or Mac. The Make script from source code is designed around the tools and scripting capabilities in Linux. The main release build do not need all these stuff and is a pure Python program. You need to install Python 3 and PyQt5 in order to use Gamelist Addon.</p>
<h2 id="make">Make</h2>
<pre><code>usage: make.py [-h] [--setup] [--ui] [--build] [--package] [--clean]</code></pre>
<p>make.py is the script to build all release packages and is only relevant to the source code. It is a custom script written in Python. Running it without arguments will execute all routines. Using at least one argument will disable all other routines and just execute what is defined. All distribution related files are found in a sub folder &quot;dist&quot;. In example:</p>
<pre><code>./make.py --ui --package</code></pre>
<p>will only generate the .ui files and the distribution packages for Python only. No binary compilation is created and temporary files are not cleaned up.</p>
